# Limit Order Book

## Overview

This project implements a Limit Order Book (LOB) using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for data visualization. The order book maintains buy and sell orders, matches them according to market rules, and provides real-time updates on the state of the order book and recent transactions. This project was created for one of my university modules to understand how LOB actually works.

## Features

- Add buy and sell orders to the order book
- Automatically match orders based on price
- Display the current state of buy and sell orders
- Visualize order volumes at different prices using bar charts
- Track completed transactions with timestamps
