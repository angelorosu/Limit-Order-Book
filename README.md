# Limit-Order-Book
This project implements a Limit Order Book (LOB) using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for data visualization. The order book maintains buy and sell orders, matches them according to market rules, and provides real-time updates on the state of the order book and recent transactions.
